# Earth Observation data science course notebooks

This repository hosts notebooks that formed the practical part of the Earth Observation (EO) data science course I attended at Cranfield in May 2023. **Caution**: notebooks have not been cleaned!

## Topics covered
- Python APIs for accessing and manipulating EO data.
- Creating and visualising time series of indices (vegetation, water, etc)
- Creating scripts for managing EO data collections 
- Building EO data pipelines.

**Note**: Google Earth Engine access is required to run these notebooks.
